# After reading the [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), I clarified what middleware really does:

Middleware runs before a request is completed, allowing you to:

- Modify request or response headers
- Redirect users based on request conditions (e.g., A/B tests, geolocation, auth)
- Rewrite URLs dynamically
- Respond directly without reaching a route handler

‚úÖ Ideal Use Cases:

- Redirecting unauthenticated users
- Implementing feature flags or experiments (A/B testing)
- Applying custom headers globally or for route groups

‚ùå Not Ideal For:

- Slow data fetching
- Session or authentication management that requires database lookups or JWT decoding
  Middleware should stay fast and lightweight, since it runs on every matching request.

üß† Final Thought on Middleware and Auth

Although our middleware verifies JWT tokens to protect specific routes, this is still considered a lightweight and appropriate use of middleware in Next.js. We‚Äôre simply reading a cookie and verifying its signature ‚Äî no database lookups or slow operations involved.

According to the Next.js Middleware documentation, middleware is not suited for full session management, such as fetching user data or decoding complex tokens. For those tasks, it‚Äôs better to use server-side functions like getServerSideProps, API routes, or server components.

In our case, middleware is used responsibly:

- ‚úÖ Fast, stateless JWT check
- ‚úÖ Route protection and redirect logic
- ‚ùå No DB reads or heavy computations

This approach ensures good performance while keeping protected areas secure.
